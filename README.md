# Griddy: A 2D Pathfinding console program that implements DFS and BFS and a recursive search to navigate a 2D Grid.

Preface: This project is an applicative summarization of everything that i have learnt so far in Year 1 of University. 
This project deals with Object oriented Programming, it deals with graphs and graph algorithms, it deals with Recursion and i think that it is a Good display of my knowledge and my ability with Programming so far. 

However, this project is not entirely completed, as i want to build upon it and develop a way to render the Paths produced by the algorithms, so stay tuned for that. 


REQUIREMENTS: 
-Python 3 Installation. I was not able to convert the .py to an executable file, so the way to run the program would be to have python installed and double click on the main.py file in File explorer, alternatively you could open it with Idle or any other Python compatible IDE and run it from there. 

What is Griddy:
Griddy is a Console 2D grid pathfinding program which the user sets the start, destination and obstacles on a 2D Grid, and then chooses an Algorithm to use to get from the starting point to the destination whilst avoiding the Obstacles. 

Bugs/ Quirks:
Unfortunately you cannot add Obstacles when using the DFS or BFS. Will work on fixing this soon. 


Future updates:
-Bug Fixes
-Working on a way to render the grid and the algorithms to the user.
